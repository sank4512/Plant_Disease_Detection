## 🌟 Overview
This project is a **Plant Diseases Prediction App** built using **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow**. The app allows users to upload plant leaf images and get a disease prediction using a pre-trained deep learning model.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Interactive **Streamlit** web app 🖥️
✅ Uses a **pre-trained CNN model** (`trained_cnn_model.keras`) 🧠
✅ Accepts **leaf images** for disease classification 🌱
✅ Provides **real-time disease detection** 🏥

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🔥 **TensorFlow/Keras** (Deep Learning Model)
- 🎨 **Streamlit** (Web App Framework)
- 📊 **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)
- 📈 **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)

## ⚡ Installation & Setup

### 🏗️ 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sank4512-plant-diseases-prediction.git
cd sank4512-plant-diseases-prediction
```

### 📦 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ 3. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 🎯 How to Use
1. 📸 Upload an image of the **plant leaf**.
2. 🎯 Click on **Predict Disease**.
3. 📢 The app will display the **predicted disease** along with confidence scores.

## 🔢 Example Output
```
Predicted Disease: Powdery Mildew
Confidence: 92.5%
```

## 📊 Model Performance
